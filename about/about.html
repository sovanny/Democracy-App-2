<h4>What is KAI'STEER?</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Students' opinions are rarely taken into consideration when decisions and changes are made on university campuses. </li>
    <li>Our proposed solution is to enable students to raise awareness of what matters to them, enable students to show their support of other’s issues and then make sure that popular issues get brought forward to the right decision makers.</li>
    <li>The “nothing to lose, all to win”-mentality coupled with the extremely quick and easy contribution cycles grounded in the platform can incentivise students to become active users.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>How to use it?</h4>
<ul>
    <li><h5>Post Generation</h5> With few clicks and a small text you are able to create, describe and share what you want to raise awareness of. This will from now on be referenced as posts.</li>
    <li><h5>Voting</h5>As a user of the application/platform you are presented with a feed of everyone’s posts. Here you can investigate the contents of the posts and vote if you agree or disagree with the post. These votes counts towards what the next steps of the post should be.</li>
    <li><h5>Feedback</h5>It very important that the platform is completely transparent. That is why you always can see how many has voted for or against a post, and what the status of a post is. When a post gets created it enters a “trial stage”. Here it is seen whether or not the post can get traction or if people are not interested. If a posts sits too long without enough students voting for it, it will enter the “Cancelled stage”. If it on the other hand excesses a certain threshold of votes it goes to the “In progress stage”. In this stage a platform employee will investigate the post and choose whom to contact to try to resolve the issue. All steps taken in this process is shortly documented and made visible on the platform. All stages of the posts are clearly visible except for the initial trial stage.</li>
